## How to contribute to Simpletwitter?
The easiest way to contribute, is:

* Find an open [Issue](https://github.com/pravee42/simpletwitter/issues).
* Fork the project and create a new branch related to the issue.
* Make a PR solving the issue.

If there's no issues you feel like contributing to, but still find the project interresting, you're free to open a new issue and and follow the above procedure.

We're also always in need of writeups, so if you've completed challenges using Simpletwitter, feel free to contribute those as well.

I'm aming to keep a high level of code coverage, but as a contributer you're not required to have full coverage of your contributions, it's totally valid to make a PR, and comment that you'd like help with writing meaningful tests.

Generally we need more tools that makes it easier to to write solves for CTF challenges, so it can be data conversion, socket programming, file analysis and much more.
